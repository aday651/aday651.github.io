I'm Andrew, currently a fifth year PhD student in [Statistics](http://stat.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). My thesis advisor is [Prof. Tian Zheng](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/). 

Broadly, my research interests can be thought of as being in the realm of "theory of applied statistics" - theoretical work for statistical and machine learning methods as they are used in practice. In particular, my current research focuses on the analysis of network embedding methods (such as node2vec) from a statistical perspective. See my [Research](https://www.adavison.co.uk/research/) page for a more detailed breakdown about my current thoughts and interests.

Prior to beginning my PhD, I completed my undergraduate (BA) and masters (MMath) degrees in [Mathematics](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/) at [Kings' College](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). In my (vanishing amounts of) spare time, I like to cook, bake and go rock climbing/bouldering.
