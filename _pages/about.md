I'm Andrew, a sixth (and final) year PhD student in [Statistics](http://stat.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). My thesis advisor is [Prof. Tian Zheng](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/). 

My research interests focus around machine learning methods for network embedding methods, examining these from a statistical perspective and seeking methodological improvements of these methods. I'm also interested in the implications of using the learned embedding vectors for different downstream tasks in machine learning. See my [Research](https://aday651.github.io/research/) page for a more detailed breakdown about my current thoughts and interests.

Prior to beginning my PhD, I completed my undergraduate (BA) and masters (MMath) degrees in [Mathematics](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/) at [Kings' College](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). In my (vanishing amounts of) spare time, I like to cook, bake and go rock climbing and bouldering.
