I'm Andrew, currently a fourth year PhD student in [Statistics](http://stat.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). Broadly, my research interests can be thought of as being in the realm of "theory of applied statistics" - theoretical work for statistical and machine learning methods as they are used in practice. This corresponds to considering statistical and computational aspects of various inference and prediction algorithms, and examining the interplay between the two - see my [Research](https://www.adavison.co.uk/research/) page for a more detailed breakdown about my current thoughts and interests.

Prior to beginning my PhD, I completed my undergraduate (BA) and masters (MMath) degrees in [Mathematics](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/) at [Kings' College](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). In my (vanishing amounts of) spare time, I like to cook, go rock climbing/bouldering, and (beginning) to run.
