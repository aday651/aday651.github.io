I'm Andrew, currently a fourth year PhD student in [Statistics](http://stat.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). Broadly, my research interests are various statistical and computational aspects of machine learning techniques, the corresponding algorithms used to make inferences, and the interplay between these aspects - see my [Research](https://www.adavison.co.uk/research/) page for a more detailed breakdown about my current thoughts and interests.

Prior to beginning my PhD, I completed my undergraduate (BA) and masters (MMath) degrees in [Mathematics](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/) at [Kings' College](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). In my (vanishing amounts of) spare time, I like to cook, go rock climbing/bouldering, and (beginning) to run.
