In Summer 2021, I was a mentor for the [Public Interest Technology Data Science Corps (PITDSC)](https://stat.columbia.edu/2021-public-interest-technology-data-science-corps-projects/) program between [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) and [Lehman College](http://lehman.edu/), which was a REU program focusing on data science research questions with an "obvious societal impact".

I have taught the following courses:

* (Summer 2019-2021) "Core Mathematical Skills for Statistics/Data Science", an intensive short sequence of sessions reviewing the necessary parts of undergraduate calculus and linear algebra necessary for a masters' degree in Statistics or Data Science at Columbia. In 2019 I developed the course and delivered this in person. In 2020 I delivered the course via a sequence of 10/15 minute videos, each focusing on an individual topic. In 2021, I held recitation classes for the course.
* (Summer 2018) I lead a sequence of 10 review sessions (approx. 90 minutes each) for PhD students taking the 'Statistical Inference' qualifying exam.

I've also been a teaching assistant for the following courses:

* (Fall 2021) GR5206 Statistical Computing and Introduction to Data Science
* (Summer 2021) UN4206/GR5206 Statistical Computing and Introduction to Data Science
* (Spring 2021) UN2102 Applied Statistical Computing ([course page](https://leewtai.github.io/courses/stat_computing/syllabus.html))
* (Fall 2020) GR5206 Statistical Computing and Introduction to Data Science
* (Spring 2020) GU4241/GR5241 Statistical Machine Learning
* (Fall 2019) UN2103 Applied Linear Regression Analysis 
* (Fall 2018) GR5242 Advanced Machine Learning ([course page](https://aday651.github.io/files/teaching/AdvancedML18/index.html))
* (Summer 2018) GU4241/GR5241 Statistical Machine Learning
* (Spring 2018) GR6203 Theoretical Statistics II (PhD-level class)
* (Fall 2017) GR5204 Statistical Inference
* (Spring 2017) GU4231/GR5231 Survival Analysis
* (Fall 2016) GU4203 Probability
