Over the past couple of years, I've taught the following:

* (Summer 2019) "Core Mathematical Skills for Statistics/Data Science", an intensive short sequence of sessions reviewing the necessary parts of undergraduate calculus and linear algebra necessary for a masters' degree in Statistics or Data Science at Columbia
* (Summer 2018) I lead a sequence of 10 review sessions (approx. 90 minutes each) for PhD students taking the 'Statistical Inference' qualifying exam

I've also been a teaching assistant for the following courses:

* (Fall 2019, current) UN2103 Applied Linear Regression Analysis 
* (Fall 2018) GR5242 Advanced Machine Learning ([course page](https://aday651.github.io/files/teaching/AdvancedML18/index.html))
* (Summer 2018) GU4241/GR5241 Statistical Machine Learning
* (Spring 2018) GR6203 Theoretical Statistics II (PhD-level class)
* (Fall 2017) GR5204 Statistical Inference
* (Spring 2017) GU4231/GR5231 Survival Analysis
* (Fall 2016) GU4203 Probability

(As you can see, I try my best to have some variety in what I TA.)
