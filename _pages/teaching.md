Over the past couple of years, I've taught the following courses:

* (Summer 2019, 2020) "Core Mathematical Skills for Statistics/Data Science", an intensive short sequence of sessions reviewing the necessary parts of undergraduate calculus and linear algebra necessary for a masters' degree in Statistics or Data Science at Columbia. In 2019 this was delivered in person; in 2020 this was delivered via a sequence of 10/15 minute videos each focusing on a different topic.
* (Summer 2018) I lead a sequence of 10 review sessions (approx. 90 minutes each) for PhD students taking the 'Statistical Inference' qualifying exam.

I've also been a teaching assistant for the following courses:

* (Spring 2021, current) UN2102 Applied Statistical Computing ([course page](https://leewtai.github.io/courses/stat_computing/syllabus.html))
* (Fall 2020) GR5206 Statistical Computing and Introduction to Data Science
* (Spring 2020) GU4241/GR5241 Statistical Machine Learning
* (Fall 2019) UN2103 Applied Linear Regression Analysis 
* (Fall 2018) GR5242 Advanced Machine Learning ([course page](https://aday651.github.io/files/teaching/AdvancedML18/index.html))
* (Summer 2018) GU4241/GR5241 Statistical Machine Learning
* (Spring 2018) GR6203 Theoretical Statistics II (PhD-level class)
* (Fall 2017) GR5204 Statistical Inference
* (Spring 2017) GU4231/GR5231 Survival Analysis
* (Fall 2016) GU4203 Probability
